# Alternatives

**Problem space:** a recreational runner training for a 5K to half-marathon race, often without a sports watch, needs a training plan that changes when their real runs differ from the plan and tells them why it changed, so they can trust it enough to keep following it.

## Properties

We fixed these seven properties before evaluating any product.
Each is written as a question a runner in the problem space would ask.

| ID  | Property          | The question behind it                                                                                         |
| --- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P1  | Plan adaptation   | When my run goes differently from the plan (missed, shorter, slower, faster), does the plan change, and what triggers it? |
| P2  | Explainability    | When the plan changes, am I told why, in terms I can check?                                                    |
| P3  | Input requirements | What must I own or record for the product to work: a specific watch, heart rate, phone GPS, or manual entry?   |
| P4  | Onboarding        | What do I have to answer and do before my first planned workout?                                               |
| P5  | Cost model        | What is free, what is paid, and what do I lose if I stop paying?                                               |
| P6  | Data portability  | Can I take my runs and my plan somewhere else (FIT, GPX, CSV, API)?                                            |
| P7  | Load and recovery | Does the product measure training load or fatigue, and does that measurement change the plan?                  |

## ALT-01: Runna

**Kind:** direct competitor.
**Link:** <https://www.runna.com/>
**Version looked at:** help-center articles and pricing page as published on 2026-09-29.
**Depth of evaluation:** read the official help center (plan creation, skipping, realignment, Pace Insights, recovery, subscription, account deletion) and the pricing page.

Did not use the app hands-on in this pass.

**Problem it solves:** gives a runner a structured, subscription-based plan toward a race or distance goal, which adjusts when sessions are skipped and suggests new paces from speed sessions.

**Observations by property**

| Property | Observation |
| --- | --- |
| P1 Plan adaptation | Skipping a single run makes the plan "adapt around your completed sessions"; rearranging a run to another day does not trigger recalibration ([skipping a run](https://support.runna.com/en/articles/15012850-how-and-when-to-skip-a-run-managing-missed-sessions-in-your-training-plan)). After more than 3 missed workouts or a missed week, left unticked and unskipped, Plan Realignment offers to extend, rebuild, restart, or continue, and the choice cannot be undone ([Plan Realignment](https://support.runna.com/en/articles/10026375-how-to-use-the-plan-realignment-feature)). Pace Insights recommends new paces from intervals, tempo runs, time trials and some long runs; the user must accept ([Pace Insights](https://support.runna.com/en/articles/14656203-what-are-pace-insights-and-how-do-they-work)). |
| P2 Explainability | For Pace Insights, the Plan tab shows "Why you received your latest status" and which workouts contributed, with a chart of the last 5 speed workouts, and the change can be rejected or reverted ([Pace Insights](https://support.runna.com/en/articles/14656203-what-are-pace-insights-and-how-do-they-work)). For skip-driven recalibration, the help article describes no reason shown to the user. |
| P3 Input requirements | Phone-only recording works. Syncs with Garmin, Apple Watch, Fitbit and COROS ([Garmin with Runna](https://support.runna.com/en/articles/6169639-using-your-garmin-watch-with-runna), [pricing](https://www.runna.com/pricing)). Pace Insights excludes walk/run sessions and manually recorded workouts. |
| P4 Onboarding | Plan tab, then Create Plan, plan type (Race, Distance, Improvement, General), then ability level, current mileage, runs per week, and goal, then a preview ([creating a plan](https://support.runna.com/en/articles/15443877-how-to-create-a-training-plan-in-runna)). Time to first workout: not measured. |
| P5 Cost model | $19.99 per month or $119.99 per year (US), 7-day trial; free users get week 1 of any plan; monthly subscribers see 4 weeks ahead, annual subscribers the whole plan ([pricing](https://www.runna.com/pricing), [subscription](https://support.runna.com/en/articles/8112247-managing-your-runna-subscription)). |
| P6 Data portability | Account deletion permanently deletes all data and the article mentions no export ([deleting your account](https://support.runna.com/en/articles/10502455-deleting-your-runna-account)). We found no documented FIT, GPX, or CSV export and no public API. Completed runs do reach Garmin or Strava through sync. |
| P7 Load and recovery | No numeric load or fatigue metric is described as driving the plan. Recovery is rule-based: deload weeks, "Long Run Protection", tapers ([recovery](https://support.runna.com/en/articles/15272605-how-does-runna-build-recovery-into-your-training-plan)), and a manual "Not Feeling 100%" option of 3 to 14 days at 4 reduction levels ([feeling unwell](https://support.runna.com/en/articles/12809806-feeling-unwell-how-to-adapt-your-training-plan)). |

**Strengths**

- The only product in our set that documents showing the user why a change happened, with the contributing workouts and the option to revert (P2).
- Works from a phone alone, so a runner without a watch can start (P3).

**Weaknesses**

- A beginner on a walk/run plan gets no pace adaptation, because Pace Insights excludes walk/run sessions.
  This matters for the part of our problem space that starts from zero running fitness.
- Realignment only starts after more than 3 missed workouts or a whole week, and it cannot be undone, so a runner who misses two runs gets no adjustment and a runner who picks the wrong option cannot go back.
- No documented export, and deletion removes everything, so a runner who leaves loses their plan history.
- Monthly subscribers see only 4 weeks of their plan.

**Could not find out:** the logic behind skip-driven recalibration, and how long onboarding takes.

## ALT-02: Garmin Coach (Run Coach and Expert Running Plans)

**Kind:** direct competitor, bound to Garmin hardware.
**Link:** <https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=IkvWNeIoSd48GIYCjkhlo7>
**Version looked at:** Garmin support FAQs at the content versions shown on 2026-09-29 (Garmin Coach FAQ v122.0, missed workouts FAQ v63.0, load FAQ v72.0), and the Garmin blog post of 28 April 2025.
**Depth of evaluation:** read the official support FAQs, the product blog, and the Connect+ pricing FAQ.

Did not use a Garmin device in this pass.

**Problem it solves:** gives a Garmin watch owner a free adaptive plan that changes daily from the watch's own performance and health measurements.

**Observations by property**

| Property | Observation |
| --- | --- |
| P1 Plan adaptation | Run Coach workouts "change day-to-day based on your performance and health metrics"; Expert plans adapt from benchmark runs ([Garmin Coach FAQ](https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=IkvWNeIoSd48GIYCjkhlo7)). A missed workout cannot be rescheduled; "the plan automatically adjusts" ([missed workouts FAQ](https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=o21H5a4cSU52FwFAy0R6Z5)). The blog names VO2 max, lactate threshold, training history, sleep, stress and recovery as inputs ([Garmin blog](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/blog/fitness/garmin-training-plans-for-runners/)). |
| P2 Explainability | None of the FAQs or the blog post we read says whether the user is shown why a workout changed. |
| P3 Input requirements | Needs a compatible Garmin watch; Run Coach runs only on newer models, and many older models get only Expert plans ([Garmin Coach FAQ](https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=IkvWNeIoSd48GIYCjkhlo7)). The blog advises wearing the watch while asleep. |
| P4 Onboarding | In Garmin Connect: training focus, current weekly distance and average pace, goal distance, recommended plan, workouts per week, available days, long-run day, then race or end date. Without a VO2 max estimate the plan starts with benchmark workouts ([Garmin Coach FAQ](https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=IkvWNeIoSd48GIYCjkhlo7)). |
| P5 Cost model | Free with a compatible device ([2018 press release](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/newsroom/press-release/sports-fitness/2018-train-for-a-5k-with-garmin-coach-free-adaptive-training-plans-from-garmin/)). Connect+ ($6.99 per month or $69.99 per year) adds guidance content ([Connect+ FAQ](https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=awrd4J1Du94fqM3SxQ0biA)). The real cost is the watch. |
| P6 Data portability | Single activities export as FIT, TCX, or GPX ([export FAQ](https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=BBISz2o26Z37QlY14mTLF9)). The Connect Developer Program is "only for business use" ([developer FAQ](https://developer.garmin.com/gc-developer-program/program-faq/)). We found no documented export of the plan itself. |
| P7 Load and recovery | Tracks acute load (7 days), chronic load (28 days), and a load ratio of acute to chronic ([training load FAQ](https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=SEkNpdGyhR917js0qQL3Q6)). Daily Suggested Workouts use load and recovery, but are replaced by the Coach plan's workouts when a plan is active ([suggested workouts FAQ](https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=oYknGZ910l1pfBNzkDHX6A)). The FAQs do not say whether the load ratio changes a Run Coach plan. |

**Strengths**

- The richest input signal in our set: sleep, stress, recovery, and measured fitness, all from one device (P1, P7).
- Free for anyone who already owns a compatible watch (P5).

**Weaknesses**

- A runner without a compatible Garmin watch cannot use Run Coach at all.
  This excludes the part of our problem space that runs with only a phone.
- A missed Run Coach workout cannot be moved by the runner, which is rigid for someone whose free days change week to week.
- The reason for a change is not documented as shown to the user, so a runner told to do less has to take it on trust.
- Expert plans assume 7:00 min/mile or slower and are generated in imperial units ([Garmin Coach FAQ](https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=IkvWNeIoSd48GIYCjkhlo7)).

**Could not find out:** whether and how changes are explained in the app, the adaptation logic, and plan export.

## ALT-03: Hal Higdon plans (free static plans and the Run With Hal app)

**Kind:** adjacent substitute, a static printable schedule, with an optional paid app.
**Link:** <https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/half-marathon-training/novice-1-half-marathon/>
**Version looked at:** Novice 1 Half Marathon page and printable PDF, and Run With Hal help-center articles (updated between 2019 and 24 February 2026), on 2026-09-29.
**Depth of evaluation:** read the free plan and its printable PDF, and the app help center.

Did not use the app hands-on in this pass.

**Problem it solves:** gives a runner a well-known, free, fixed schedule toward a race, which many runners print and follow on their own.

**Observations by property**

| Property | Observation |
| --- | --- |
| P1 Plan adaptation | The free plan is a fixed 12-week table; the runner is told "Don't be afraid to juggle the workouts" ([Novice 1 page](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/half-marathon-training/novice-1-half-marathon/), [printable PDF](https://www.halhigdon.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Novice-1-Half-Marathon-Printable.pdf)). The paid Hal+ app reschedules "based on your compliance with the plan" and when settings change ([what the plan adapts to](https://runwithhal.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033786051-What-will-the-plan-adapt-to)). |
| P2 Explainability | The static plan explains its reasoning in prose on the page, but it never changes. We could not verify whether the app says why it rescheduled. |
| P3 Input requirements | Static plan: none, run by feel at "conversational pace". App: phone GPS; syncs only with Garmin, not Apple Watch, Strava, or others ([device sync](https://runwithhal.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033786871-Can-I-sync-my-Apple-Watch-Strava-or-other-device-account)). |
| P4 Onboarding | Static plan: choose a plan and meet its prerequisite, "ability to run 3 miles, three to four times a week" ([Novice 1 page](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/half-marathon-training/novice-1-half-marathon/)). App onboarding: not verified. |
| P5 Cost model | Web and PDF plans are free. The app is free with Hal+ at $6.99 per month or $59.99 per year ([app cost](https://runwithhal.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033786711-How-much-does-the-app-cost)). The same plan on TrainingPeaks costs $29.95 ([TrainingPeaks listing](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/training-plans/running/half-marathon/tp-139213/hal-higdon-half-marathon-novice-1)). |
| P6 Data portability | The PDF is fully portable. We could not verify any app export or API. |
| P7 Load and recovery | Rest days and cross-training are written into the schedule, but there is no load metric in the free plan ([Novice 1 page](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/half-marathon-training/novice-1-half-marathon/)). |

**Strengths**

- Zero cost and zero setup for the free plan: a runner can start today with a printout (P4, P5).
- The plan's reasoning is written out, so a runner understands the structure even though it never adapts (P2).

**Weaknesses**

- The free plan never adapts; after a missed week the runner decides alone how to "juggle" the schedule, which is exactly the decision a beginner is least equipped to make.
- The app adapts to compliance and settings only; no performance or fatigue signal is documented.
- The app syncs only with Garmin, so a runner recording on another device has to log runs twice.
- Most app help articles date from 2019, so current behaviour is uncertain.

**Could not find out:** app onboarding, whether the app explains changes, and export.

## ALT-04: GoldenCheetah

**Kind:** open-source, self-hosted desktop software (GPL-2.0).
**Link:** <https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah>
**Version looked at:** v3.8, released 2026-09-20 ([release notes](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/releases/tag/v3.8)), and the project wiki, on 2026-09-29.
**Depth of evaluation:** read the v3.8 release notes, the Plan chart wiki page, the running FAQ, and the first-steps guide.
Did not install it in this pass.

**Problem it solves:** gives a technical athlete full local control of their training data, with load analysis (CTL, ATL, TSB) and, since v3.8, a manual training calendar.

**Observations by property**

| Property | Observation |
| --- | --- |
| P1 Plan adaptation | No automatic adaptation and no plan generation. v3.8 adds planned activities, a calendar, plan adherence, and an "Expected PMC" chart; rescheduling is manual, by drag and drop ([release notes](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/releases/tag/v3.8), [Plan chart wiki](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_ChartTypes_Plan)). |
| P2 Explainability | Nothing changes automatically, so there is nothing to explain. The Plan Adherence chart shows completed, shifted, missed, and unplanned activities ([Plan chart wiki](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_ChartTypes_Plan)). |
| P3 Input requirements | Imports files from most devices (FIT, TCX, GPX and others); some devices need files copied manually ([import guide](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_First-Steps_Download-or-import)). Running load needs pace zones or critical velocity set up first ([running FAQ](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/FAQ-RUNNING-&-SWIMMING)). |
| P4 Onboarding | Install the desktop app, create an athlete, set zones, import data ([first steps](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_First-Steps_What-you-need-to-do)). No goal-race questionnaire. |
| P5 Cost model | Free and open source ([repository](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah)). |
| P6 Data portability | Local files; exports to FIT, TCX, GPX, PWX, CSV, and GC JSON ([activity menu](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_Menu-Bar_Activity)); v3.8 adds schedule export and import. |
| P7 Load and recovery | Performance Management Chart with CTL (42 days), ATL (7 days) and TSB, with GOVSS and TRIMP for running ([glossary](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_Glossary)). "Expected PMC" projects load from planned activities, but the plan is never changed from it. |

**Strengths**

- The most transparent load model in our set: every number is documented and computed locally (P7).
- Complete data ownership and export (P6).

**Weaknesses**

- Desktop only, with no phone app, and built around cycling; a recreational runner would need to copy files from a phone or watch to a computer after every run.
- No plan generation or adaptation, so the load numbers never turn into an adjusted workout; the runner has to interpret CTL and TSB themselves.
- Onboarding assumes the user knows what critical velocity and pace zones are.
